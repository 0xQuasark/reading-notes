[The ethical dilemmas of self-driving cars](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/culture/technology/the-ethical-dilemmas-of-self-drivingcars/article37803470/)

This is trying to answer the classic trolley-car problem, namely that if you're controlling a railway switch, and there's a trolley car that's hurtling towards the switch; one way leads to five people tied to the tracks, and the other way leads to one person tied to the tracks, what do you do?. 

The article says that self-driving cars will have to make similar decisions, and that we need to decide what those decisions should be.

It's an interesting conundrum because, while we can recognize that humans are going to make a LOT more mistakes than self-driving cars, we're also going to be a lot more forgiving of human mistakes than we are of machine mistakes. Machines have a LOT less leeway to make mistakes than humans do.

Ultimately, it'll be interesting to see just how much control we're willing to give up to machines, and how much we're willing to trust them.
