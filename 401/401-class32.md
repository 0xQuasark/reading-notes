1. How do useReducer and useContext work together to simplify state management in a React application? 

   > `useReducer` and `useContext` in React work together to manage state in larger applications by providing a more predictable way to handle complex state logic. The `useReducer` hook accepts a reducer function and an initial state, returning the current state paired with a dispatch function. This allows for the management of more complex state logic that might involve multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.

   > On the other hand, `useContext` is used to create global state that can be accessed anywhere in the application. By wrapping the application with a Context Provider, components can access the state without having to pass props down manually at every level. Combining `useReducer` with `useContext` allows for a greater consistency and efficiency in managing state, by providing a central store and dispatching actions to update state. For instance, you could combine them to create a theme switcher, where the `useContext` provides access to the current theme, and `useReducer` updates the theme.
