[Socket.io Chat Example](https://socket.io/get-started/chat/)

1. Explain to a non-technical recruiter what the Chat Example (above) does.

   > The Chat Example provides a simple real-time chat platform. Users can type messages into a text box that are immediately seen by all other users in the chat, making communication instantaneous.

2. What proof of life are we getting on the backend from the above app?

   > The backend of the app sends and receives messages in real time. When a message is sent, the backend processes it and broadcasts it to all connected users, proving that it's actively running and handling data.

3. Socket.IO gives us the i0.emit() method to send an event to everyone.  What flag would you use if you want to send a message to everyone except for a certain emitting socket?

   > You would use the `socket.broadcast.emit()` method. This sends a message to everyone except for the socket that initiates the event.

[Rooms](https://socket.io/docs/v4/rooms)

1. What is a room and how might a room be useful?

   > A room in Socket.IO is a way to segregate users into separate groups or channels. This is useful for creating chat rooms or game lobbies where only certain users should receive specific messages.

2. How do you join a room?

   > You can join a room using the `socket.join()` function, passing in the name of the room as an argument, like `socket.join('roomName')`.

3. How do you leave a room?

   > You can leave a room using the `socket.leave()` function, passing in the name of the room as an argument, like `socket.leave('roomName')`.

[Namespaces](https://socket.io/docs/v4/namespaces/)

1. What is a Namespace and what does it allow you to do?

   > A Namespace is a way to divide your socket.io app into smaller sub-apps or modules. It allows you to isolate socket communication to a particular feature or section of your app.

2. Each namespace potentially has its own what? (hint: 3 things)

   > Each namespace can have its own set of rooms, events, and middleware.

3. Discuss a possible use case for separate namespaces.

   > Separate namespaces can be useful in large apps where different features need their own communication channel. For example, a social media app might use one namespace for chat, another for notifications, and a third for live events, each with their own rooms and events.
