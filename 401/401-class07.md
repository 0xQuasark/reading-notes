[Intro to JWT](https://jwt.io/introduction/)

1. What is a JSON Web Token (JWT)?
> A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, self-contained, digitally signed token that contains claims (information) about a user or entity, which can be used for authentication and authorization purposes.

2. When should we use JSON Web Tokens?
> JSON Web Tokens should be used when we need a secure way to transmit information between two parties, such as during user authentication in a web application.

3. Claims are expected in which structural component of a JWT?
> Claims are expected in the payload component of a JWT.

[Are JWTs Secure?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27301557/if-you-can-decode-jwt-how-are-they-secure)

1. If I get a JWT and I can decode the payload, how can we call that secure?
> Even if we can decode the payload of a JWT, it is still considered secure because the signature of the JWT ensures its integrity and prevents tampering.

2. If sending a JWT, what must sender and receiver both know? Hint, it's appended in the signature.
> When sending a JWT, the sender and receiver must both know the secret key that is used to verify the signature of the JWT.

3. Explain how concatenated content and secret can be sent and received securely to a non-technical recruiter.
> Concatenated content and secret can be sent and received securely to a non-technical recruiter by using secure communication channels, such as encrypted email or secure file transfer protocols, to ensure that the information remains confidential.

[JWTs Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=926mknSW9Lo)

1. Why use JWT?
> JWTs are used because they provide a secure and efficient way to transmit information between different systems or parties.

2. JWT is Compact and self-contained. Describe how this is useful to a non-technical friend.
> The compact and self-contained nature of JWTs means that all the necessary information is contained within the token itself, making it easy to transmit and validate without the need for additional database lookups or server calls.

3. What are the three components (the structure) of a JWT signature?
> The three components of a JWT signature are the header, the payload, and the signature itself, which are encoded and concatenated together to form the complete JWT.
