## Notes

## Readings
- [Review API Server Build](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/apps-and-libraries/api-server/)

1. Explain the difference between a query string parameter and a path parameter.
> A query string parameter is included after the '?' in a URL and is used to filter or sort data, for example `http://our-site.com?color=red`. A path parameter, on the other hand, is part of the URL path itself and is used to identify a specific resource, like `http://our-site.com/items/1`.

2. What would our API URL with a path id parameter be given the following information: 
    1. Domain: `http://our-site.com`
    1. `v3`
    1. model name: `stuff`
    1. id: `things`
> Given this information, the API URL with a path id parameter would be `http://our-site.com/v3/stuff/things`.

3. We have created a dynamic API with an "interface".  Describe how that interface works to a non-technical friend.
> The interface is like a restaurant menu. It lists all the options you can request from our API (the kitchen). When you choose something from the menu (make a request), our API prepares and serves up the data (the meal).

- [Review Auth Server Build](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/apps-and-libraries/auth-server/)

1. Describe how you would use middleware to implement basic and bearer auth.
> Middleware in this context acts like a security guard, checking credentials (basic auth with username and password or bearer auth with a token) before granting access to certain routes or data.

2. Describe the handshake necessary to implement OAuth. 
> The OAuth handshake involves three steps. The user authenticates directly with an OAuth provider (like Google), the provider gives the user a special code, which the user then trades with our server for an access token. 

3. Describe how Role Based Access Control works to a non-technical friend.
> Role Based Access Control is like having different keys for different doors in a building. Depending on your role (your key), you can access certain parts of the application (doors).
