I used to teach terminal commands for a living. It's fun diving back into learning about them again, but there were no big highlights for me, that's 20 years ago.



Getting back into terminal commands is like revisiting an old favorite for me. I used to teach this stuff, and now, it's just plain fun to learn about it again, even though there weren't any big standout moments from my teaching days twenty years back. 

I found that this [cheat Sheet](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/cheatsheet.php) is going to be very useful, but I am familiar with most, and in fact could write a few more pages :)

One of my favorite commands though is the `kill -HUP` or `kill -1`, which restarts a process instead of force-closing it. and I normally like piping STDERR messages to /dev/null
