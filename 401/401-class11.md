1. What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?

   > The 'events' module in Node.js allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming.

2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?

   > Combining Object Oriented Programming with Event Driven Programming allows for a more structured and manageable codebase. It helps encapsulate related data and behaviors into objects, while events can trigger methods within these objects.

3. Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.

   > Event Driven Programming in Node.js is like a restaurant taking orders. Instead of making one customer wait while the kitchen cooks their order (synchronous), the restaurant takes orders from multiple customers (asynchronous) and notifies each one when their order is ready (events), making the process more efficient.
