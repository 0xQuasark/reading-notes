## Introduction
A growth mindset aids in embracing challenges and persisting in setbacks, both common in career shifts. It also promotes effort, learning from criticism, and finding inspiration in others' success.

Growing a tech company and improving your programming skills are surprisingly similar. Both rely on continuous learning, stepping outside your comfort zone, and dedication to deliberate practice to overcome challenges and open new opportunities.

In my journey of leading tech companies, I've realized the power of "yet" does not only apply to the projects and products we develop, but also to personal growth. Just like students grappling with tough problems, I have faced challenges and made mistakes as a leader. But embracing the "yet" strategy, viewing these moments not as failures but as stepping stones towards improvement, is where I found my greatest advancements, both personally and professionally.

As an entrepreneur I know that the key to success isn't just about possessing high IQ or exceptional talent. It's about the grit - the relentless determination and passion to persevere through the most challenging tasks and lengthy projects. Just as a gritty mindset can predict success in diverse environments, from school classrooms to high-stakes military training, it was a consistent predictor of outcomes in the tech world too.

While success is often defined externally by various societal standards, I realized it was vital to redefine it internally for both my personal and professional growth. This did wonders for not just improving my outlook, but also instilled a more nurturing, patient work environment, emphasizing that success and failure are not absolute but part of a continuous process of growth and learning.
