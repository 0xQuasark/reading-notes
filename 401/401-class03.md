1. What is the difference between a route path and a route method?
   > The route path is like the address of a place, while the route method is like the way you want to get there (e.g., using a car or bicycle).

2. When is it appropriate to add "next" as a parameter to a route handler, and what must you do if "next" has been passed to your middleware as a parameter?
   > You add "next" when you want to pass control to the next function, and if "next" is passed to your middleware, you should call it to allow the request to move to the next middleware or route handler.

1. What is an Express Router?
   > An Express Router is like a mini-express application that you can use to group routes and middleware together.

2. By what means do we initialize express.Router() in an express server?
   > You initialize express.Router() by creating a new instance of it, usually at the beginning of your server code.
