[AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)

1. What is an EC2 Instance?

    > An EC2 Instance is a virtual server in Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for running applications on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. 

2. Name 2 use cases for EC2.

    > EC2 can be used for hosting web-servers, backend servers for online gaming, and data processing tasks such as batch processing.

3. Provide 1 reason to use ECS instead of a service such as Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com.

    > One reason to use EC2 is its scalability. It allows you to increase or decrease resources according to your needs, which is not always possible with other services like Heroku or Digital Ocean.

1. Where can we find EC2 on the AWS Console?

    > EC2 can be found in the AWS Management Console under the "Services" dropdown menu.

2. Explain the general difference between T2 Micro and XL.

    > T2 Micro is a small instance type suitable for low to moderate workloads, while XL instances are larger, offering more compute power and memory, suitable for large scale applications or databases.

3. Explain a "Compute Cycle" to a non-technical friend.

    > A "Compute Cycle" is like a worker's shift. It's the time during which the CPU (the brain of the computer) is actively doing something like processing data or running a program.

[Elastic Beanstalk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrwxAScdyT0)

1. What is Elastic Beanstalk?

    > Elastic Beanstalk is an AWS service that simplifies the deployment and scaling of web applications and services developed in Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker.

2. Describe the relationship between EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk.

    > Elastic Beanstalk uses EC2 instances to run the applications that you upload to the service. It takes care of the deployment details, capacity provisioning, load balancing, and auto-scaling.

3. Name some benefits of using Elastic Beanstalk.

    > Benefits of using Elastic Beanstalk include easy application deployment, automatic scaling, and it handles all the infrastructure so you can focus on writing your application.
