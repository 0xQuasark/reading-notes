## Readings
1. What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?

   > Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a concept in systems security that allows access rights to be assigned to users based on their role within an organization. This method of assigning permissions based on roles simplifies the management and control of access to resources.

2. Share some an example of RBAC including all possible CRUD operations and correlating roles.

   > Imagine a blogging platform. An "Admin" role could have all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) permissions, able to add, read, edit and delete all posts and user accounts. An "Editor" role might have CRU (Create, Read, Update) permissions, able to add new posts, read all posts, and edit any post, but not delete them. Lastly, a "User" role could have R (Read) permissions, only able to read posts.

3. What are the Benefits of RBAC?

   > RBAC has several benefits such as increasing security and efficiency, reducing potential errors and administrative work. It provides a simplified and standardized approach to access control, and can also help an organization comply with government and industry regulations.

1. Describe some `react-cookie` features.

   > `react-cookie` is a library that provides hooks to manage cookies within React applications. Some of its features include support for server-side rendering, loading and saving cookies with ease using hooks, and compatibility with both JavaScript and TypeScript.

2. Describe some `react-cookies` features.

   > `react-cookies` is a component-based library for managing cookies in React. It allows you to easily set, get and remove cookies, supports universal apps, offers compatibility with react-native, and also supports server-side rendering.

3. Which library would you prefer would you prefer? Why?

   > The choice between `react-cookie` and `react-cookies` depends on specific project requirements. However, for most modern applications, `react-cookie` might be preferable due to its use of hooks which aligns with the latest React patterns. It also supports both JavaScript and TypeScript which provides more flexibility for different types of projects.
