### Questions
1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
> Consider the type of operations you need to perform on the data - whether you need fast access, insertion, deletion, or if you need to maintain a certain order.

2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
> To avoid an infinite recursive call stack, ensure that you have a base case that will be met, which will stop the recursion. Also, make sure that each recursive call brings you closer to this base case.
