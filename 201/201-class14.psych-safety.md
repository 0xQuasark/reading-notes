## Why this matters
> Psychological safety is key for good teams, and it’s highly relevant to what we’re learning. As devs, we work together a lot - agile teams, pair programming, code reviews, etc. When everyone feels good enough to speak up, ask questions, and own up to mistakes, it allows the team to work together better.

> Ideas flow, bugs get squashed, and everyone levels up. Psychological safety builds the trust we need to work together and deliver that app.

> Psychological safety makes sure everyone on my team feels heard and supported. Better communication, better code, better apps, more fun!



## Questions

1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?
> Equality in that everyone speaks roughly equal amounts.
> Ability to pick up on nonverbal cues and intuit how others feel.
> Team that encourage interpersonal risk-taking and expressing vulnerability.

2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety. 
> our leadership team did not prioritize psychological safety early on. There was an uneven distribution of talk time, with myself and the CTO dominating conversations. Additionally, social sensitivity was low - it was hard to discuss tensions or conflict productively.
> I wish I had focused more on fostering norms of trust, active listening, and comfort expressing emotions/weaknesses. The high stress of a startup made this difficult, but it led to burnout and less cohesion. More check-ins on mental health and modeling vulnerability could have improved our team psychology.

What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?
> Psychologically safe teams have higher collective intelligence, increased ability to innovate, faster problem-solving, and higher job satisfaction. For a company, this builds trust, improves communication, and fosters creativity. For individuals, psychological safety lowers stress, creates a sense of belonging, and leads to professional growth and learning. 
> Overall, it enables teams to optimize collaboration, performance, and member well-being.
