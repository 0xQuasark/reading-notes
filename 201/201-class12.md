## Q&A's

### JavaScript Canvas
1. What does the `<canvas>` allow a developer to acheive?
> The `<canvas>` element allows a developer to draw 2D graphics using JavaScript code. It provides a region that can be manipulated via a JavaScript interface.

2. What is the importance of the closing `</canvas>` tag?
> The closing `</canvas>` tag is important because the `<canvas>` element requires an opening and closing tag, (unlike the `<img>` element). Any content between the opening and closing tags is fallback content that will only display if the browser does not support the `<canvas>` element.

3. Explain what the getContext() method does.
> The `getContext()` method returns a rendering context object that provides methods and properties for drawing on the `<canvas>`. It takes one parameter, the context type such as '2d', and returns an instance of a context interface like CanvasRenderingContext2D. This context interface exposes methods like `fillRect()` and `strokeRect()` that can be used to draw different shapes and graphics. So `getContext()` provides the actual drawing API after it is called on a `<canvas>` element.
