### Growth Mindset vs Fixed Mindset
* a Growth Mindset is the belief that you can improve your current state,
* in order to do so though, one should recognize that no new skill can be achieved without hard work
* Growth Mindset is to be aware not only that change is possible, but that it is only possible through adversity.

## Reminders for me to keep myself in Growth Mindset
1. when things start to feel difficult, remember: No Pain, No Gain
2. when I start to ask, "Why can't I get this", or generally despair at the amount of knowledge I don't know, remember: this too shall pass
3. The only thing that's worse than the discomfort of learning something new, is the stagnation of not learning anything at all
