# testing out committing via VScode

## Tuesday June 27th 2023

## Notes
* Git has a special label called HEAD, it basically means "You Are Here"
* Git: version control system
* Github: commericial service for hosting the data

* to do it without VSCode:
  * Create a repository online
  * click on the top right "Clone" and choose the HTTPS (cuz it's easier)
  * create/go to the local directory you want the repository to live in
  * git clone <HTTPS PATH>
  * Bada-bing! This is now sitting on your local computer
  * also worth noting, you can use github cli (gh is git's own terminal)
    * gh is worth understanding more
* `git add <FILENAME>`
