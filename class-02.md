1. What are four important features to look for in a text editor:
  * Features,
  * Ease of Use,
  * Platform Compatibility,
  * Community and Support
    
2. What do the following commands do?
  * pwd - print working directory
  * ls - list files in current working dir
  * cd - change directory to <argument>
  * mkdir - make a new directory called <argument>
  * touch - make a zero-length file in current dir called <argumnet>

 3. Explaining a command line example:
  1. we first go into a directory within our current directory called `projects` (let's assume it exists)
  2. once inside, we create a new directory called `new-project`
  3. now we create a zero-length file within this new directory called 'newfile.md' - it's worth noting that we're creating this file from another directory
  4. now we go back to the parent directory (one level above `projects`)
  5. now we look at the files with the sub-directory (`new-preoject`) of the directory we just came from (`projects`).
