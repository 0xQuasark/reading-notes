## Q&A's
# Questions
1. What is an expression in JavaScript?
2. Why would we use a loop in our code?
3. When does a for loop stop executing?
4. How many times will a while loop execute?

# Answers
1. A piece of code that produces a value, such as a variable, a function call, or a mathematical operation.
2. Use loops in code to repeat a set of instructions multiple times, saving time and reducing repetitive code.
3. A for loop stops executing when the specified condition becomes false or when there are no more iterations left.
4. A while loop will continue executing as long as the specified condition remains true, potentially running indefinitely if the condition is not met.
