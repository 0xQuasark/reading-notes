## Q&A's
# Questions
1. What is `control flow`?
2. What is a JavaScript `function`?
3. What does it mean to `invoke` - or `call` - a function?
4. What are the parenthesis `()` for when you define a function?

# Answers
1. this is the order in which things are executed in a program/script
2. a function is a block of code that performs a certain task. It can be reused and called as many times as is necessary.
3. this is the act of calling the function to execute the task. One typically invokes or calls the function by using its name, and passing it necessary arguments. Worth noting: those arguments passed to the function, are now known as its parameters.
4. The parenthesis invokes/calls the function, they also provide the bounds in which arguments are passed to the function
